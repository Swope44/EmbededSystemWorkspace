<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

- This workspace is for embedded system development targeting ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino platforms.
- Prefer code that is portable across these platforms when possible.
- Include hardware interfacing examples (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, etc.).
- Use C/C++ for Arduino and ESP32, and Python or C/C++ for Raspberry Pi.
- When generating code, include comments for hardware setup and wiring.
- Suggest cross-compilation and flashing instructions where relevant.
- Recommend PlatformIO, Arduino, and C/C++ extensions for best experience.
